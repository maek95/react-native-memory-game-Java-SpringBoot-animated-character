//export const host = "http://192.168.1.201"; // egna ip-address istället för localhost?
//export const host = "http://10.0.2.2" // localhost but for virtual device

export const host = "http://10.201.25.120" // network ip so I can connect from my own physical mobile as well... basically connecting to the computer's localhost
